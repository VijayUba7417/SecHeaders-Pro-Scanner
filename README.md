# 🎯 SecHeaders Pro Scanner - Offensive Hacker Suite

`SecHeaders Pro Scanner` by Vijay is engineered specifically for penetration testers, offensive security analysts, and red teamers who need to perform instant, live audits of web application HTTP response headers across tabs without page refreshes, detect missing defensive controls, identify information disclosure banners, and capture pristine executive screenshots for vulnerability reports.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **⚡ Real-Time Auto-Scanning:** Automatically re-scans live headers immediately when switching tabs or navigating inside Single Page Applications (`SPA`) without requiring manual page refreshes.
- **📊 OWASP Top 10 Header Compliance:** Automated grading (`A+` down to `F`) based on severity weights (`Strict-Transport-Security`, `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, `COOP`, `COEP`, `CORP`).
- **⚠️ Information Disclosure Detection:** Flags server fingerprinting and banner leaks (`Server`, `X-Powered-By`, `X-AspNet-Version`, `X-Generator`).
- **📸 Screenshot Prep Mode:** With one click, hides interactive buttons/tabs, expands summary cards, and inserts assessment metadata (`Target Host`, `Pentest Timestamp`, `Scope`)—producing a clean, professional artifact ready for client audit reports.
- **📋 Remediation Code Snippets:** Copy hardened, ready-to-deploy header configurations directly to your clipboard for client developers.
- **💾 Markdown & JSON Export:** Instant 1-click export of structured finding summaries for DefectDojo, Jira, and executive PDFs.

## 🛠️ Two Ways to Use

### Option 1: The 1-Click Bookmarklet Sidebar (Zero-Install)
Ideal for quick pentest assessments or environments where you cannot install custom browser extensions.

1. Open `index.html` inside your browser.
2. Drag the **`🎯 SecHeaders Scanner`** button up to your Chrome Bookmarks Bar.

### Option 2: Manifest V3 Chrome Extension (Native Side Panel API)
Ideal for deep, unfiltered HTTP header interception (`chrome.webRequest` & `chrome.sidePanel`) without cross-origin (`CORS`) limitations and live tab synchronization.

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode** in the top-right toggle switch.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extension directory (`./chrome-extension`).
